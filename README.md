<p>When using all the controllers while the program is running. I expiernce a HTTP ERROR 500. This being said I believe it is just something on my side that is strange. This however does not effect how the solution works and it still inserts all the data that was given with no problem.</p>

  <li>If there is an error just simply click the back arrow and the data will still be there and visible as it should</li>
</ul>
