<p>When using all the controllers while the program is running. I expiernce a HTTP ERROR 500. This being said I believe it is just something on my side that is strange. This however does not effect how the solution works and it still inserts all the data that was given with no problem.</p>

<h1>How to work the program:</h3>

<h3>NOTE:</h1>
<p>If you get an error after performing an action just hit back and then the data that was inserted will still be there.</p>

<h3>Registering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click register.</li>
  <li>Enter any email and password in the proper format.</li>
  <li>Click register</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inserting Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click on any of the controllers (Zone, Categories, Devices</li>
  <li>Click on the '+' next to the heading</li>
  <li>Insert the data that is required</li>
  <li>Click create</li>
  <li>If there is an error just simply click the back arrow and the data will still be there and visible as it should</li>
</ul>


<h3>Updating data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the pencil icon when you have enetered a controller page</li>
  <li>Change the data to what you would like it to be</li>
  <li>Click Save</li>
  <li>The data will then be updated</li>
